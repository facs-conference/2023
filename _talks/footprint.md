**Presenter**: Hans Dieter Hiep  
**Session Chair**: Clemens Dubslaff

We introduce a new way of reasoning about invariance in terms of footprints in a Hoare logic for object-oriented components. 
A footprint of an object-oriented component is formalized as a monadic predicate that describes which objects on the heap can be affected by the execution of the component. 
Invariance of an assertion is ensured by means of a form of bounded quantification which excludes references to a given footprint.
