**Session Chair**: José Proença

As modern software systems control more and more aspects of our everyday 
lives, they grow increasingly complex. Therefore, the goal of modern IT 
science does not only lie in the development of powerful and versatile 
systems, but also in providing comprehensive techniques to understand 
these systems. This motivates research on formal notion of cause-effect 
relations in operational models that enhance the understanding why 
properties hold or not, and which system components are mostly 
responsible for the satisfaction or violation of properties.

The talk will present recent work on formal concepts for cause-effect 
reasoning in Markov decision processes. It will present formalizations 
of causality based on the probability-raising principle and related 
algorithms for checking cause-effect relationships and finding "good"
causes for a given effect.
