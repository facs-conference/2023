Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard modelling language for workflow-based processes. Building an optimized process with this language is not easy for non-expert users due to the lack of certain support at design time. This paper presents a lightweight modelling tool to support such users to build optimized processes. First, the user defines the tasks involved in the process and possibly gives a partial order between tasks. The tool then generates an abstract graph, which serves as a simplified version of the process being specified. Next, the user can refine this graph with the minimum and maximum execution time of the whole graph computed by the tool. Once the user is satisfied with a specific abstract graph, the tool synthesizes a deployable BPMN process corresponding to that graph. Our tool is called WEASY and is available as an open source web application.
